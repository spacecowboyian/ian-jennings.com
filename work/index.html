			<h1>Ian Jennings</h1>
		</div>
		<h3>JP Morgan - iPhone </h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h6><a href="assets/jpmc-iphone-layout.png"  target="_blank">Screen flow</a></h6>
				<p>My first task working at Wall Street On Demand was to design an iPhone app to pitch to JP Morgan. This app would allow their investors to access their portfolios and make adjustments if needed.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>NAB</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h6><a href="assets/nab_trading_heatmaps-3up-selected-industry.png"  target="_blank">Sector Indices</a></h6>
				<p>This interactive visualization allows the user to quickly see which sectors gained or lost the most in market cap in a selected day. It can be played back to show where they stood throughout the day.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Markit Hub - iPad</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h6><a href="assets/Hub-iPad/01-hub-ipad-wireframes.pdf"  target="_blank">Wireframes (PDF)</a></h6>
				<p>I was responsible for gaining a complete understanding of what the current hub.com product provided on the web and translate that to the iPad while taking advantage of the interface to improve upon the experience.</p>
				<p>These wireframes were my first step after sketching to start outlining ideas for the product.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h6><a href="assets/Hub-iPad/02-Markit-hub-iPad-sales.pdf"  target="_blank">Prototypes (PDF)</a></h6>
				<p>I worked with a team of other designers to finalize the functionality and apply the skin to the app</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h6><a href="assets/Hub-iPad/bezier/default.html"  target="_blank">Bezier Curve Test</a></h6>
				<p>I spent a lot of time working with a developer to create a working example of what we wanted to see on the dashboard of the app. The idea was eventually scrapped for that project but will be used for hub.com</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h6><a href="assets/Hub-iPad/barcap-taphold2.mov"  target="_blank">Tap and hold video</a></h6>
				<p>In order to get an idea across to a white label client I had to make a quick video with keynote to explain a tap and hold interaction</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Markit Hub - Web</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="multi">
				<h6>Early exploration - <a href="assets/Hub-Web/spec/hub-dex.png" target="_blank">Directory</a> | <a href="assets/Hub-Web/spec/hubbar-IM.png" target="_blank">Clustering</a></h6>
				<p>We were trying to throw out really wild ideas against hub.com to see what stuck. These were a couple of my early concepts.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h6><a href="assets/Hub-Web/01-hub-bar-whiteboard.pdf"  target="_blank">Whiteboard Session (PDF)</a></h6>
				<p>I drew these up to explain my idea for the interactive "hub bar" that would be the key element of the new hub.com design.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h6><a href="assets/Hub-Web/interactive/index.html"  target="_blank">Interactive Hub Bar Demo (FireFox Only)</a></h6>
				<p>People were having a tough time grasping the idea of the hub bar from early wireframes so I decided to put it in to code. This helped better explain the interactions and assisted me in finding gaps in the design that the wireframes did not cover.</p>
				<p>Click around on the bar at the bottom of the page to discover all of the features. Be sure to try and chat with someone from the directory list. I even wired up how conversations would look.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="multi">
				<h6>Hub.com prototypes - <a href="assets/Hub-Web/hub-Stream-v1-1.png"  target="_blank">Stream</a> | <a href="assets/Hub-Web/hub-Briefcase-Details_v1.png"  target="_blank">Briefcase App</a> | <a href="assets/Hub-Web/hub-web-app-provider.png"  target="_blank">Provider App</a></h6>
				<p>Some samples of prototypes created to show the new styles of hub.com and to explain the ideas behind hub "apps"</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Protonotes</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h6><a href="assets/protonotes-notes-new.png"  target="_blank">Create new note</a></h6>
					<p>An internal project to improve our communication tools around prototype feedback and revisions. This system would allow users to select areas of a prototype and create a note about that section. They could also create tags and link the area to another prototype to create a simple interactive click through prototype.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		<h3>MCS Header</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h6><a href="assets/MCS/index.html"  target="_blank">Interactive wireframe</a></h6>
					<p>Another designer had come up with the top concept for an overflow drawer of tools in a dock of sorts. I questioned the functionality of the design so I developed it out so we could play around with it and see how it actually worked. Drag the window so the top menu overflows into the drawer indicated by the flashing of the button on the right. Click the button to see the overflow. Drag items around between the dock and the overflow.</p>
					<p>I concluded that there was a better way and coded it as well for comparison and that is seen lower on the page. There is no more overflow and it also allows the user to only have a few tools in the main dock even if they may have access to many</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		<h3>Rular</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h6><a href="assets/rular/index.html"  target="_blank">Interactive Demo (Work in Progress)</a></h6>
					<p>I wanted to create a tool for doing a task that we designers have to do all the time, measuring our designs for developers. I have lots of plans for this but it is currently in its infancy.</p>
					<p>Mouse over the image and use the magnifier to click first on the end of your measurement. Find the end of the area to be measured and click again.</p>
				</li>
