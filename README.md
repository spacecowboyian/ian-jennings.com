Code for my portfolio site. Built on [harp](http://harpjs.com) for simple ejs, markdown and less compilation. Publishes to [surge.sh](http://surge.sh) which is just plain wonderful.

### Installation

`npm install`

### Run

`harp server`

Should live on localhost:9000

The build process uses github actions and deploys to github pages.
