Code for my portfolio site. Built on [harp](http://harpjs.com) for simple ejs, markdown and less compilation. Publishes to [surge.sh](http://surge.sh) which is just plain wonderful.

### Installation

```npm install```

### Run

```harp server```

Should live on localhost:3000

I built an npm script to run ```harp deploy``` then push the deploy directory to surge. If you decide to actually set all this up... you won't be able to push... cause SSH keys. But you should totally set up your own surge account and make it happen for your site. I don't even care if you want to use my markup and make your site look just like mine... because it's not much to look at ;)
