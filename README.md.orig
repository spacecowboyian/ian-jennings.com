Code for my portfolio site. Built on [harp](http://harpjs.com) for simple ejs, markdown and less compilation. Publishes to [surge.sh](http://surge.sh) which is just plain wonderful.

### Installation

```npm install```

### Run

```harp server```

Should live on localhost:3000

I built an npm script to run ```harp deploy``` then push the deploy directory to surge. If you decide to actually set all this up... you won't be able to push... cause SSH keys.
